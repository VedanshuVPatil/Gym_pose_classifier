# Gym_pose_classifier
This is a simple yet powerful video-based action recognition model that classifies gym exercises—specifically Bicep Curl, Lateral Raise, and Squat—from short video clips.

It uses a custom-trained 3D convolutional model and is wrapped in a Streamlit web interface so anyone can upload a video and get an instant prediction. Think of it as a mini fitness-aware AI that can watch a video and tell you what workout is happening!

 Features
 Input: Short gym videos (~2–4 seconds)

 Model: Basic 3D CNN trained on 3 exercise classes

 Fine-tuning and inference scripts in PyTorch

 Streamlit-based UI for simple interaction

 Real-time predictions with confidence scores

 create sample videos folder to put your test video and inside data folder create 3 subfolders on name of position of workout and put sample videos in it for training.
